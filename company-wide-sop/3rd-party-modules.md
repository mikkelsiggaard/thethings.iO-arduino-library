# 3rd Party Modules

## Technical requirements

Before a module can begin to be used on a Salecto customers webshop, a technical assessment needs to be done. This should be done properly in order to prevent that modules are sold where we cannot accept them on our platform. 

### Semantic Versioning

{% hint style="info" %}
See the official documentation here: [https://semver.org](https://semver.org)
{% endhint %}

Semantic Versioning is a naming scheme for software releases. E.g. version "4.3.5". 

The idea is to be able to characterize the backwards compatibility of a module update.   
The scheme is structured with three integer numbers with these names: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH

From the example "4.3.5", "4" means that for this module there has been a total of four MAJOR releases.   
"3" means that for the fourth MAJOR release there has been three MINOR releases.   
"5" means that for the third MINOR release there has been five PATCH releases. 

#### Definitions

1. MAJOR versions is for when a new release, containing _new functionality_, **will NOT** guarantee compatibility with other software-systems relying on this package.
2. MINOR versions is for when a new release, containing _new functionality_, **will** guarantee compatibility with other software-systems relying on this package.
3.  PATCH versions is for when a new release, containing _only bug fixes_, **will** guarantee compatibility with other software-systems relying on this package.
