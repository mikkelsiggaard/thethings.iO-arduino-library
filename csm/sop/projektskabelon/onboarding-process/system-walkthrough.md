# System Walkthrough

**Once a staging environment has been created:**

* Send login credentials to the customer.
* Send link to our Help Center \(when this is up and running\).

**The course covers the following:**

* Product creation
* Category creation
* Menu / Mega Menu Properties / Property set \(if the customer is technically inclined - use your own judgement\)
* Design configuration - front page products \(if the customer is technically inclined - use your own judgement\)
* Modules / acquisitions

**Notes:**

* Record video of the training process with Screencastify/Loom and send the video to the customer after completion of course.
* Explain to the customer, that this is a staging environment. All content created here will remain ready to be published to the live shop.
* If the customer seems information fatigued, take a break and suggest continuing the course another day.
